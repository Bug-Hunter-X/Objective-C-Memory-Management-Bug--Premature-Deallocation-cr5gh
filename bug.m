In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to object ownership and the `retain`/`release` mechanism (or its modern counterpart, Automatic Reference Counting or ARC).  Consider the scenario where an object is created and passed to a method, but the method does not retain it.  If the original reference goes out of scope, the object is deallocated prematurely, leading to a crash or unexpected behavior.

For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod:(NSString *)aString {
    self.myString = aString; // Without retaining, the string may be deallocated
}
@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        NSString *str = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@
